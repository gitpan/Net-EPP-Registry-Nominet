Net::EPP::Registry::Nominet version 0.01_01

Released: 9th December 2013


INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module you can follow the usual procedure which is:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Note that most of the tests will be skipped unless you provide a tag and
a password for connection to the Nominet EPP Testbed. See
http://registrars.nominet.org.uk/registration-and-domain-management/registrar-systems/epp/testbed
for details of how to register for the testbed. Before running "make
test", set up the environment variables NOMTAG and NOMPASS like so:

	export NOMTAG=MYTAG NOMPASS=mypass

If you have the CPAN module installed then you can install the module
from the command line like so:

	$ cpan Net::EPP::Registry::Nominet


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Net:EPP:Registry::Nominet is designed to allow synchronous management of
.uk domains.

This module extends Net::EPP::Simple to cope with the unorthodox EPP
implementation currently in use by Nominet, the registry with
responsibility for the .uk namespace. It is intended to have a
compatible interface to Net::EPP::Simple so far as is practical.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

Bug Fix (90776): Test suite improved such that if the client IP address
is not registered to use the testbed, RAM should not be exhausted even
on low memory environments. Requires newest Net::EPP from svn, however.

Test suite updated to match changes in Nominet's testbed data set.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

All of the documentation is in POD format in the module source. Once the
module has been install you can use

	perldoc Net::EPP::Registry::Nominet

to read it. Alternatively, you can view the man page with

	man Net::EPP::Registry::Nominet
